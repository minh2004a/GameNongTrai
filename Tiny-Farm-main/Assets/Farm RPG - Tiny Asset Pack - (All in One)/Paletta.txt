Hey everyone, I’d like to apologize for the messy palette and let you know that not all of the colors I used are included in it. Unfortunately, when I first started, I didn’t have much experience with color selection. I ended up creating random extra palettes for specific parts of the pack and often forgot to add those colors to my main palette. Many times, I needed a very specific color that wasn’t in my official palette, so I created a new one just for that purpose and never used it again. Over time, this turned into a bit of a mess!

I don’t work this way anymore, but the pack has grown too large for me to rework the entire palette. So, I just wanted to apologize for that!
